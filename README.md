# EC400_FinalProject
Different test codes for the EC 400: Reinforcement Learning Final Project. This is working with PyTuxKart and python in order to minimize times. Note, due to issues with my computer, only 50 training runs were run.

# 3rd Plan
[planner_3.py](planner_3.py)

# 4th Plan

# 5th Plan
[planner_5.py](planner_5.py)

# 6th Plan
[planner_6.py](planner_6.py)

# 7th Plan
I tried to work with the planner that came from on of my teammates, which worked the best. He had several layers, which took way took too long ony my computer, so I cut it down to see how it performed. The results show that [planner_7.py](planner_7.py) worked decently well, especially comparing to the previous attempts.
